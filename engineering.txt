Due to some unfortunate illnesses on our end, we were delayed in our starting of this project. However, after reading through the gRPC
python tutotiral, we feel pretty good since the proto file seems to take care of all the low-level stuff for us. In fact, most of our code will remain
the same for the client UI, it's just that our server and client will be on a bidirectional stream in communicating.

It might be better to have each action be its own function. First, let's set up a "test_server" and "test_client" to make sure everything
will work properly at scale.
